# PrivateSpark

PrivateSpark is a beautiful, beginner-friendly interface concept for running local AI models on your own device.

## What this prototype includes

- Local-first dashboard UI with a **first-run wizard**
- Clean **chat experience** with beginner-safe language
- **Drag-and-drop file analysis** placeholder flow
- Curated **one-click model manager** cards with hardware hints
- Privacy-forward messaging emphasizing local execution by default

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open: <http://localhost:4173>

## Vision

This project is intended to evolve toward:

- Ollama / llama.cpp / MLX local runtime integrations
- Voice mode with Whisper + TTS
- Offline-first notes, projects, and vector search
- Optional encrypted sync and explicit cloud fallback controls
